# Plans For Future Development

In the future, I would like to add more exercises, add a full sample workout routine, and add different workout formulas. In addition, I would like to add videos of each exercise or links to descriptions. In the far future I would like people to video tape themselves completing exercises and use image recognition software, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to analyze user's form completing exercises and offer suggestions for improvement.
